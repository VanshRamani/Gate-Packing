# Bin-Packer
To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Edit the input.txt file: Update this file with the gate dimensions and coordinates in the required format.
2. Edit the paths in run.py: At the end of the run.py file, modify the paths to your input and output files.
3. Visualize the output: The output can be visualized using Pygame and the provided Visualize function. If you prefer to run the code without visualization, simply comment out the visualizer.display() function call.

This will allow you to see the packing solution and analyze its performance
